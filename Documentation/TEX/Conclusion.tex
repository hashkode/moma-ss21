\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, we show a data-driven approach that was derived during an extensive optimization procedure. We yield a powerful model to classify acceleration data from human gait recorded with smartphones. The combination of \ac{LSTM} models, which work with time series data, and feature-based models, namely \ac{SVM} and \ac{RF}, achieves an accuracy of more than \unit{99}{\%}. Empirical research by the authors showed that 1-stage stacking is the optimal way to implement this combination, while 2-stage stacking pretends to perform better on generalization - indicated by the higher validation accuracy.

We estimate further potential by enhancing the axes-sorting algorithm. This could be done by coordinate transformation in case 6- or 9-axes IMU-sensor-data is available. This technique may improve performance and reduce the false positive rate. This would allow new applications e.g. to recognize Parkinson or other gait-affecting conditions.
